Description: Implements a partial linear mixed-effects model (PLMM) featuring a 
  random intercept and applies a lasso penalty to both the fixed effects and the 
  coefficients associated with the nonlinear function. The model also accommodates
  interactions between the nonlinear function and a grouping variable, allowing
  for the capture of group-specific nonlinearities. Nonlinear functions are 
  modeled using a set of basis functions. Estimation is conducted using
  an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and the package offers flexibility 
  in choosing between various information criteria for model selection, including 
  BIC, BICC, or EBIC. Post-selection inference is carried out using a debiasing
  method, while inference on the nonlinear functions employs a bootstrap approach.
